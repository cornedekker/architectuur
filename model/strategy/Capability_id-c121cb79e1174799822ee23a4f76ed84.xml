    documentation="Knowledge &amp; content management is a digital capability used to organize, manipulate, store, retreive, distribute, secure and backup digital assets, such as textual content and media content that have significanan value to an organization. The majority of the funtionalities provided by a content management system can be reused for Digital Asset Management, including metadata and taxonomy, because the asset lifecycle is managed the same way as the content lifecycle is accross creation, publishing maintenance and archiving.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On one hand, a digital asset is a subset of digital content mentioned earlier and a digital asset is therefore managed as digital content is managed. On the other hand, a digital asset is a subset of organizational assets that has significant monetary value and should therefore be created, maintained and protected as an enterprise asset of an organization. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The characteristics of a digital asset comes from both the digital content and enterprise asset aspects, and the Digital Asset Management capability manages the combined characteristics of a digital asset.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
