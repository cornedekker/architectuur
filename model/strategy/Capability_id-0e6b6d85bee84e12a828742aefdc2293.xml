    documentation="Online Advertising is a digital capability used to plan, execute, monitor and measure advertisement in digital space. As it is a type of paid advertising, it is planned in a similar way that Paid Search and Content Targeting are planned. Online Advertising, also known as Display Advertising, is a traditional way to buy a section of online media, such as a news channel, to push marketing messages to a customer mass or customer segment through banners or other types of advertisements made of images, flash, videos, audio and text. When a Display Advertisement is shown on a search website, it is not considered part of a search result by users, even though it can be shown based on search keywords. "/>
