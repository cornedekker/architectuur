    documentation="Cross-Business Integration is a digital capability used to consolidate,  integrate, or harmonize the different digital plans and policies across the different business units, to achieve a single face to the same customers and provide consistent messages, content and offers throughout Social Interaction, Digital Marketing and Digital Commerce. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each business unit tends to develop its own silo set of digital channels, resulting in different business units investing in redundant channels that are not coordinated at corporate level. It often confuses customers with inconsistent marketing offers and reduces opportunities for cross-sell and upsell of different products and different services from different business units.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cross-Business Integration prevents each business unit from sprouting its silo channels without corporate-level synergy across the entire organization, and ensures that an organization can build a consistent brand image for its customers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;"/>
