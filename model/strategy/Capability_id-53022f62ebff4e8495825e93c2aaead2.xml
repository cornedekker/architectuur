    documentation="Customization &amp; personalization is a set of digital capabilities used to manage the relationship between an organization and its customers by knowing more about their customized wants and personalized needs. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By definition, customization is performed to meet ‘Wants’ that customers express explicitly because they know what they want, whereas Personalization is conducted to meet ‘Needs’ that an organization identifies through analysis of customer behaviours because customers are often unaware of what they need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital content including web content, knowledge, and digital assets from Knowledge &amp; Content Management is delivered through Social Interaction, Digital Marketing and Digital Commerce capabilities to a customer segment, or an individual customer, as per the information on customer relationship maintained in Customization &amp; Personalization capabilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Customization &amp; Personalization capabilities have a middle-office processing style in terms of the IT architectural pattern: small transactions occur frequently on a real-time basis in the front-office, while large transactions occur intermittently in the back-office and middle-office processing style is in between the front-office and back-office processing styles. The middle-office operations are integrated seamlessly with the customerfacing front-office operations so that front-office staff or IT systems are well equipped with customized or personalized content to interact with and respond to an individual customer, or customer segment, to socialize with them, and market and sell to them effectively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Customization &amp; Personalization has the following digital capabilities:&#xD;&#xA;- Customer Preference Management&#xD;&#xA;- Customer Communication Management&#xD;&#xA;- Social Behaviour Management&#xD;&#xA;- Interaction Tracking &amp; Management&#xD;&#xA;- Customer Loyalty Management&#xD;&#xA;-  Digital Customer Services"/>
