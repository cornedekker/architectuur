    documentation="Digital Brand Marketing is a digital capability used to build and promote a brand to customers in the digital space, so that customerâ€™s perception of the brand can move from the initial stage where a customer is aware of the brand, all the way up to the final stage where the customer is loyal to the brand.&#xD;&#xA;This capability should be closely integrated with customer experience management in that a brand is built out of the result of customer experience.&#xD;&#xA;By definition, a brand is a collection of customer experiences with all levels of the organization that owns the brand."/>
