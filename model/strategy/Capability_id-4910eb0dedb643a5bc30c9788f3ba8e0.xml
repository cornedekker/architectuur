    documentation="Digital Data Policy Management is a digital capability used to create and update policies, standards, procedures and guidelines on creating, updating, retrieving, maintaining, archiving and deleting enterprise digital data, including master data, reference data, code data, transactional data and analytical data, to ensure the data is consistent, secure and compliant withinternal control policies, and external laws and regulations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Before the contemporary digital era, data was generated by, and mostly used within an organization, which is a controlled environment. The majority of users were employees and internal staff, and they mostly consumed the data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the digital age, a massive amount of semi-structured and un-structured data is generated and used outside an organization, due to social and mobile trends. The majority of users are customers and prospects, and they are both the providers and consumers of the data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this reason, the data needs to be generated, used, shared, stored and deleted in a way that not only creates new business value, but also protects existing business value, highlighting the importance of a data policy. Data Policy documents commonly include policies, standards and procedures around:&#xD;&#xA;- Scope of enterprise data.&#xD;&#xA;- Responsibilities for data use and management.&#xD;&#xA;- Data life cycle management from data creation to deletion.&#xD;&#xA;- Data security.&#xD;&#xA;- Policy breaches, etc.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
