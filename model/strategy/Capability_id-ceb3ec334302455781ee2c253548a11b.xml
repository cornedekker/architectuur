    documentation="Distributed Data Store Management is a digital capability used to store nonrelational data as well as relational data into memory-based or disk-based storage in such a way that the stored data is accessed and used by the front, middle, and back-office capabilities effectively and efficiently.  In other words, the capability should address the challenges arising from the fact that the data generated from digital transactions is massive in amount, unstructured or semi-structured in format, and highly distributed in the transaction environment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The massive data should be stored in the memory layer or the persistent storage layer. As part of the efforts to address the challenge of massive data, an In-Memory Database architecture catering for high throughput and low latency has been evolving to store and process the massive data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Distributed cache and file systems have been gaining momentum to address the challenges of storing and processing massive data."/>
