    documentation="Customer Segmentation is a digital capability used to divide a customer base into a few segments of customers that share similar characteristics, including demographics, behaviours and mindsets, and spending habits. While the basics of traditional customer segmentation methodologies have not changed in the contemporary digital era, a few more considerations relevant to digital technology and digital business can be added on top of the traditional basics of segmenting customers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Segmentation Methods&#xD;&#xA;There are various ways of performing customer segmentations by combining the following dimensions.&#xD;&#xA;- Demographics-based segmentation: segmentation by customer demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education and occupation.&#xD;&#xA;- Behaviour-based segmentation: segmentation by shopping behaviours such as purchased products and services, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary: recency of latest purchases, frequency of&#xD;&#xA;purchases and volume of purchases)&#xD;&#xA;- Value-based segmentation: segmentation by total benefit and cost of a customer.&#xD;&#xA;- Need-based segmentation: segmentation by needs that are often unfulfilled and unmet.&#xD;&#xA;- Attitude-based segmentation: segmentation by attitude toward a brand such as brand loyalty, promotion sensitivity and sensitivity to brand switch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Behaviour-based or value-based customer segmentation are commonly used as these enable business to focus its marketing resources and efforts on profitable customer segments. Unfortunately, both segmentation methods are heavily based on information from current and past shopping activities, and information on needs and attitudes of customers tend to be ignored, making the segmentation results less reliable."/>
