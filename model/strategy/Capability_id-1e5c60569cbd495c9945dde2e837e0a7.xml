    documentation="Social Crisis Management is a digital capability used to mitigate the probability and the impact of major incidents that threaten to harm the organization and stakeholders.&#xD;&#xA;The digital capability not only decreases the probability that a major incident occurs, but also reduces the impact of the major incident on business when it actually occurs.&#xD;&#xA;It encompasses abilities to identify a threat before a crisis occurs, and mitigate the threat, and to deal with the crisis when, or after it occurs.&#xD;&#xA;Stories about a food poisoning incident and news of a car accident from a car malfunctioning reported on multiple social websites are for example considered a threat or crisis to the food company and the car company respectively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;"/>
