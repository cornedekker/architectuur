    documentation="Conversion Analytics is a digital capability used to analyse a large amount of conversion data, capture trends and patterns, and help make decisions on future strategy to promote conversion in a conversion funnel. The conversion data includes multi-year historical data of customer conversions during a digital customer journey from awareness towards purchase. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The conversion data should be analysed for trends and patterns that have consistently occurred in the past and may therefore happen again in the future, so that decision makers can use the trends and patterns to develop insights into customer conversion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This digital capability works closely with the Conversion Rate Optimization capability by providing conversion trends and patterns through deep-dive analysis of historical conversion data. The only difference between the two capabilities is that Conversion Rate Optimization is focused on the real-time status of a conversion funnel and recent progress in conversion to help determine ways to promote current  conversion rate, whereas Conversion Analytics looks at historical trends of conversion to identify patterns and establish longer-term strategy to increase future conversion rate."/>
