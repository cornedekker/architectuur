    documentation="Content Targeting is a digital capability used to increase website traffic by showing ads on content publisher websites of the content network where the content of these websites are relevant to the ads.&#xD;&#xA;Content Targeting for an advertisement is performed with the assumption that the viewers of the content of the content publisher websites are the potential target audience of the advertisement. &#xD;&#xA;Search engines offer a network of content publisher websites - also known as content network or delivery network - for this purpose.&#xD;&#xA;Content Targeting is a type of paid inclusion where an ad is shown on the content network of a search website, whereas Paid Search is another type of paid inclusion where an ad is shown on a search website.&#xD;&#xA;Content Targeting is different from Paid Search. An advertisement that is relevant to the keywords a user keyed in is delivered to the user in Paid Search, whereas an advertisement that is relevant to the content of a web page a user is viewing is delivered to the user in Content Targeting.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
