    documentation="User Interaction Services is a digital capability used to support interaction between users and digital applications, and communication and collaboration between users. User Interaction Services are responsible for delivering business functionalities of the digital capabilities in the front, middle and back-offices to users, and exposing the business functionalities as user interfaces on end-user devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;User Interaction Services have frequently been referred to as presentation Logic by the layered or multi-tier architecture paradigm. The digital environment has posed a few new challenges for the traditional User&#xD;&#xA;Interaction services to transform to a digital capability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, there are too many different digital device platforms. The everincreasing and ever-evolving end-user digital devices have been creating different software platforms and hardware features that require different programming Logic for interfaces with users, and for communication with server-side digital applications, making digital practitionersâ€™ jobs even harder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, digital transactions require real-time, dynamic changes of content on digital devices. Before the contemporary digital era, data was less frequently created or updated. Now, social websites are a prime example to see how frequently data is created or updated. Digital content needs to be delivered to digital devices as soon as it is created or changed."/>
