    documentation="Digital Channel Management is a set of digital capabilities used to harmonize, consolidate, or integrate multiple digital channels that are used for the interactions between target customers and all levels of an organization, to streamline customer experience across the multiple digital channels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most customers accessed more than a single online channel to interact with an organization long before the contemporary digital era. The customer behaviour of using multiple digital channels has since been far more complicated due to the proliferation of multiple digital devices. The only solution to respond to the proliferation of the digital devices and channels best, is not to become channel-intelligent, but to become channelagnostic. Organizations should stop building channel-specific marketing services and IT services, and start building unified marketing services and supporting IT services that can be provided on any channel, so that customers barely recognize the difference in services between multiple channels. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This approach will improve customer experiences in the digital space significantly, and reduce the complexity of digital channel management. This is the key to successful Omni-channel management.&#xD;&#xA;Digital Channel Management has the following digital capabilities:&#xD;&#xA;- Channel Mix &amp; Optimization&#xD;&#xA;- Cross-Business Integration&#xD;&#xA;- Cross-Channel Integration&#xD;&#xA;- Multi-Device Presentation"/>
