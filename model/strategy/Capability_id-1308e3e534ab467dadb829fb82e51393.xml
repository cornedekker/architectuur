    documentation="Cross-Channel Integration is a digital capability to have all digital channels integrated and connected seamlessly to deliver consistent and seamless customer experiences across different digital channels.&#xD;&#xA;This digital capability aims to achieve the vision of channel agnostic integration or omni-channel convergence, in which customers barely recognize difference of services provisioned and provided in different&#xD;&#xA;channels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The traditional multi-channel approach allows, or even encourages competition between multiple channels by comparing and rewarding their financial performances, making each channel a silo that does not collaborate with others. The multi-channel approach had merit as it delivered immediate financial results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the modern digital era, it is believed that collaboration between different digital channels provides more advantages than competition between them. Put simply, the total financial benefits gained from fast conversion resulting from seamless transition between channels are better than those obtained from promoting competition between different channels."/>
