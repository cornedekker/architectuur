    documentation="Reporting &amp; Dashboard is a digital capability used to establish and maintain performance indicators and metrics, and measure and report performance of digital capabilities against the metrics to assist digital decision makers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Collection of source data required to measure performance against indicators and metrics needs to be designed in such a way that it is captured automatically. The automated collection of source data is the most critical factor for the success to this capability. Online dashboards and reports should be comprehensive to provide a landscape of key metrics, but easy enough for management to understand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the other Digital Intelligence capabilities are more focused on data population, data storage, and data analysis, the Reporting &amp; Dashboard capability is more focused on presenting analysis results to users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Reporting &amp; Dashboard capability retrieves the analysis results from the other Digital Intelligence capabilities, combines the results, and presents them in such formats as tables, graphs, and charts to communicate the complicated results to decision makers in easier ways. The results can be presented as a dashboard on PC and mobile screens, and be printed as a paper-based report.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The layout of the online and offline reports may be pre-defined so that the reports can be created by a computer batch job before a user requests it. The batch jobs process a large amount of the analytical data using intensive computation, and are therefore performed outside business hours to avoid a negative impact on the performance of digital business transactions in the front-office and middle-office.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;"/>
