    documentation="Digital Data Services (Digital data management) is a set of digital capabilities used to collect, store, distribute, control and search data that is used for all the Digital Capabilities. The data used in the Digital Capabilities includes master data, reference data, metadata, transactional data and analytical data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The data used in digital transactions differs from the data used in traditional transactions in many ways. A significant amount of the data used in digital transactions is not in a structured format, and relational database and SQL (Structured Query Language), which have been around for more than three decades, are therefore no longer effective to manage the un-structured and semi-structured data generated from digital transactions. This is where a nonrelational database, or NoSQL, technologies come in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The amount of un-structured and semi-structured data generated from digital transactions poses a challenge for traditional data warehousing architecture in particular. It has such a massive volume that traditional data warehousing systems canâ€™t scale enough to keep up with the ever-increasing data volume. Digital Data Management can address the challenge by introducing a new data store architecture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital Data Management should also address the challenge of searching through the massive amount of un-structured or semi-structured data for information that users want. The following digital capabilities are sitting under Digital Data Management:&#xD;&#xA;- Non-relational Data Management&#xD;&#xA;- Distributed Data Store Management&#xD;&#xA;- Enterprise Search&#xD;&#xA;- Master Data Management&#xD;&#xA;- Data Quality Management&#xD;&#xA;- Digital Data Policy Management"/>
