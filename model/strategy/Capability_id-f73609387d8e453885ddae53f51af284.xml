    documentation="Parallel Processing Services is a digital capability used to process massive sets of semi-structured and un-structured data, as well as structured data, in  parallel on distributed computing nodes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This capability lends itself well to digital transactions and many Cloud service providers have created Cloud service offerings built on the parallel processing paradigm to efficiently process and analyse the massive amount of&#xD;&#xA;data coming from digital transactions, e.g. AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce). Parallel Processing Services is primarily used by Digital Intelligence capabilities to sort, calculate and summarize the massive amount of data during their analytical processes. The capability can also lay the groundwork for some of the front-office digital capabilities. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Social Listening capability can for example take advantage of this processing power to filter and sort raw data from social websites, and find patterns in customer voice. The idea behind the Parallel Processing concept is to break down a large set of un-structured or semi-structure data into many smaller segments of data, process the data segments on distributed nodes in parallel, and assemble the outputs from all participating nodes.&#xD;&#xA;A common architecture for parallel processing has two types of components: Master and Slaves. The Master component plans the entire job consisting of many tasks and allocates the tasks and data to multiple Slave components. Slave components execute the tasks and analyse the data, and return their outputs to the Master component for final assembly of the output.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
